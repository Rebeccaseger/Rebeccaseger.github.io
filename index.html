      <h3> READING TIPS: The light we lost by Jill Santopolo. </h3>
      <p> There are days that change the course of somenone's life forever, and these days usually do not stand out until they are reflected upon. Sometimes things happen that are so sweeping
        that they are immediately standouts, the day immediately etched into memory forever. "The Light We Lost" is a novel of the way love appears and changes people's entire lives: how
        memories can affect the present and how one person can alter the course of a life forever. </p>

      <h3> TRAVEL DIARY: What not to miss at Oahu, Hawaii </h3>
      <p> When visting Oahu it is easy to get stuck at Waikiki beach, but the main island of Hawaii has so much more.
        Here is what you not should miss out of if you ever travel to Oahu: </p>
    <p>  1. Hanuma bay nature preserve, a snorkeling paradise along the south coast of Oahu. PS. come here early in the morning to avoid the largest congestion.
      2. Hike Diamond Head or Koko Crater Trail, when visiting a island of Hawaii hiking is mandatory, because the view is out of this world.
      3. North Shore, nothing is more famous on Oahu then the North Shore with it's enormous waves during winter. But the coast is worth driving during all seasons,
      with it's cozy little towns, beautiful beaches (not as crowded as Waikiki) and pineapplecultures.
      4. Nu'uanu Pali Lookout, do not miss this fantastic lookout point. PS. Be aware of the bees. </p>

      <h2> My texts and thoughts </h2>
      <p> As Eleanor Roosvelt once said: You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really
        stop to look fear in the face. You must do the thing you think you cannot do. </p>
      <p> Fear is a common feeling and especially when doing something that force you to step outside your comfort-zone, which most of our dreams make us do.
        When you do something that scares and challenge you, when you do something that makes your heart beat alot faster you grow as a human being.
        When you refuse to let the fear of failing and for the unknown limit you, thats when your dreams comes true. </p>
